/**
 * Builds the {@link RowLevelPrincipal} for the request in flight.
 *
 * <p>Everything it needs — placement, role ids — is already on the authority
 * cache entry that authorised the request a moment ago, so this costs no query.
 * That is not an optimisation but the premise: a scope is evaluated on every
 * list, and a lookup here would be a lookup per request per resource.
 *
 * <p>Nothing is read from the access token, and nothing was captured at sign-in.
 * A token minted this morning says who you are; where you sit is answered now,
 * from a cache the features that change it invalidate. Somebody moved to another
 * department at lunchtime is scoped to the new one on their next request.
 *
 * <h2>Why the authorization service is looked up lazily</h2>
 *
 * <p>This is the one place in the application where the dependency graph is
 * genuinely circular, and it is worth understanding rather than working around
 * again in the next slice:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   AuthorityCache -&gt; UserService -&gt; OrganizationService -&gt; RowLevelSecurity
 *                  -&gt; RowLevelPrincipalResolver -&gt; AuthorizationService -&gt; AuthorityCache
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Resolving <em>who you are</em> means reading rows, and reading rows means
 * knowing who you are. It did not appear while {@code tasks} was the only
 * managed resource, because {@code TaskService} is a leaf that nothing in the
 * auth chain depends on. It appears the moment a resource <em>inside</em> that
 * chain — {@code organizations} and {@code departments}, which
 * {@code UserService} needs to resolve a placement — comes under management,
 * and it would appear again for {@code users} or {@code roles}.
 *
 * <p><b>The cycle is only about construction order, not about logic.</b> The
 * authentication path itself is never scoped: it runs before any principal
 * exists, and {@code RowLevelSecurity.scope} answers the full scope when there
 * is none. So the edge that has to be deferred is this one, and deferring it
 * here fixes it once for every resource that will ever be added rather than
 * being rediscovered per feature.
 *
 * <p>An {@link ObjectProvider} rather than {@code @Lazy}: the deferral is then a
 * visible property of the field, with somewhere to write down why, instead of an
 * annotation that reads like a performance hint.
