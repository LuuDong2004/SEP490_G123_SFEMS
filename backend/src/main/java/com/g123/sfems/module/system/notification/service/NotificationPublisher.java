/**
 * Puts a raised notification on its recipient's live connection.
 *
 * <p>Delivery only. The row written by {@code NotificationService} is the
 * record, and it is complete without this: somebody offline finds the
 * notification waiting at their next sign-in, and the bell reads it over HTTP
 * like anything else. What this adds is that somebody who is <em>online</em>
 * does not have to ask.
 *
 * <p>That framing is what keeps the failure modes boring. If the socket is
 * closed, the bus is down, or the client is on a node this message never
 * reaches, nothing is lost — only deferred to the next time the bell loads.
 *
 * <h2>The destination</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code /user/queue/notifications}, resolved by Spring to the recipient's
 * own sessions. The user name it matches on is the account id as a string,
 * which is what {@code StompAuthChannelInterceptor} sets as the principal name
 * — the two have to agree or every message is addressed to somebody the broker
 * considers absent.
