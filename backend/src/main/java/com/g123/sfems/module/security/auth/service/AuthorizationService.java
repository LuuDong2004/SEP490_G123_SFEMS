/**
 * Turns the identity in an access token into the authorities
 * {@code @PreAuthorize} reads.
 *
 * <p>This is the half of authorisation that used to live in the token itself.
 * Moving it out is what keeps the token a constant few hundred bytes however
 * large the permission model grows; keeping the answer in
 * {@link AuthorityCache} rather than in the database is what stops that costing
 * a query per request.
 *
 * <p>The result is that neither cost is paid. Nothing is carried in the token,
 * and nothing is read per request — but because the cache is invalidated by the
 * features that change the data, rather than expiring on a timer, a permission
 * revoked is a permission gone on the very next request.
 *
 * <p>It lives in the {@code auth} slice and reaches the user feature through
 * {@code UserService}, never its repository — the same rule every other slice
 * follows.
