/**
 * Stamps every answer with what the caller may currently do.
 *
 * <p>The browser holds a cached copy of its permissions so that hiding a button
 * is a local decision rather than a request. The problem that creates is
 * telling it when that copy stops being right — an administrator can change
 * somebody's role while their dashboard sits open.
 *
 * <p>Rather than open a channel for that, this rides along on traffic the
 * application is already producing: a short header on every response, which the
 * client compares against the one it holds. A dashboard makes a request every
 * few seconds — a navigation, a table, a refetch — so in practice the change
 * lands immediately, at the cost of no extra request, no held connection and no
 * database read. The value comes out of {@code AuthorityCache}, in memory.
 *
 * <p>What it does not cover is a tab left completely idle, which sends nothing
 * and so hears nothing. React Query's refetch-on-focus closes most of that: the
 * moment somebody returns to the tab there is traffic again. A push channel is
 * the honest fix for the rest, and is worth building when there is a second
 * reason to have one.
 *
 * <h2>Why an advice and not an interceptor</h2>
 *
 * <p>A {@code HandlerInterceptor} would have to write the header in
 * {@code preHandle}, because by {@code postHandle} a {@code @RestController}
 * has usually committed the response and a header set then is dropped without a
 * word. But {@code preHandle} runs <em>before</em> the handler — so the one
 * response that matters most, the answer to the request that just changed
 * somebody's roles, would carry the version from before the change.
 *
 * <p>{@link ResponseBodyAdvice} runs after the handler and before the body is
 * written, which is the only window where the value is both current and still
 * settable. By then the service's transaction has committed and the cache has
 * been evicted, so the stamp reflects the change the caller just made.
