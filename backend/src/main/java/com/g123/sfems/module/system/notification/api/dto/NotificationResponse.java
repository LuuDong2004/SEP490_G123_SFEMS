/**
 * One notification, as the list endpoint and the live channel both report it.
 *
 * <p>The same shape on both paths on purpose: the bell prepends what arrives on
 * the WebSocket to the list it fetched over HTTP, and two shapes would mean the
 * client rendering the same thing two ways depending on how it arrived.
 *
 * <p>{@code recipient} is absent, and that is the point — every endpoint is
 * already scoped to the caller, so the field would carry no information while
 * inviting a client to filter on it.
 *
 * @param read a convenience for the client, derived from {@code readAt} so the
 *             UI does not have to know that read state is stored as a timestamp
 * @param link a frontend route to open, or null
