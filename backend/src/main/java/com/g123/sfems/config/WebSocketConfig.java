/**
 * The live channel: STOMP over WebSocket at {@code /ws}.
 *
 * <p>Built for notifications, and deliberately not for permissions —
 * {@code X-Auth-Version} already carries those on ordinary traffic for no extra
 * connection. What this exists for is the class of thing an HTTP response
 * cannot carry, because the server has something to say when the client was not
 * asking: a notification arriving, a job's progress, another person opening the
 * record you are editing.
 *
 * <h2>Server to client only, for now</h2>
 *
 * <p>No {@code @MessageMapping} anywhere: nothing is accepted <em>from</em> a
 * client. That is not a limitation of the transport but a decision about
 * surface area — every inbound destination is an endpoint to authorise, and
 * none of the features built so far needs one. Presence and record locking will,
 * and they are the reason this is WebSocket rather than Server-Sent Events,
 * which cannot carry the client half at all.
 *
 * <h2>The broker is in memory, so this is single-node</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code enableSimpleBroker} keeps subscriptions in this JVM. A notification
 * raised on one node reaches a client connected to another because
 * {@code NotificationPublisher} fans out over {@link
 * com.g123.sfems.shared.messaging.PostgresEventBus} and each node delivers to its
 * own sessions — so user-targeted messages are already correct across nodes.
 * What is <em>not</em> correct across nodes is a broadcast {@code /topic}, which
 * only reaches subscribers on the node that sent it. Adding one means either
 * fanning it out the same way or switching to a broker relay
 * ({@code enableStompBrokerRelay}) with RabbitMQ behind it.
